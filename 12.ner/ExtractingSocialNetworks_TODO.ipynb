    "Your main task here will be to create a social network of people mentioned in text.  You will need to implement the following two functions: `get_nodes`, which returns a list of characters in a text along with a weight for them (e.g., their frequency of mention in the text) and `get_edges`, which returns a list of positive weights between those character nodes (if two characters do not have a tie between them, their weight is 0 and you don't have to include them in the edge list).\n",
