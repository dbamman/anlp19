The story takes place in the fictional town of Greendale in "the state of Northern California" and centers on high-schooler Lane Myer , whose girlfriend Beth  dumps him for the arrogant and bullying captain of the high school ski team, Roy Stalin. Lane cannot get past this rejection and decides that death is the only way out of his misery. His half-hearted attempts at suicide, however, always fail, with comedic consequences. Lane's family is odd: his mother, Jenny  is a sort of deranged Stepford wife and perhaps the world's worst cook; his genius little brother, Badger never speaks but can build lasers and attract trashy women; and his father, Al  is convinced Lane is using drugs. Lane's best friend, Charles de Mar  attempts to inhale everyday substances, like the nitrous oxide in a whipped cream can , Jell-O or snow, as if it were cocaine because he "can't even get real drugs here." The film also introduces two Japanese drag racing brothers, one of whom  learned English by impersonating Howard Cosell. As Lane attempts to either end his life or win back his ex-girlfriend, he gradually gets to know a new girl: a French foreign-exchange student named Monique . She is staying with Lane's neighbors  across the street, who are so annoying that she pretends she cannot speak English. Monique turns out to be a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers  and is a tough, confident soul. She helps Lane fix up his 1967 Camaro and rekindles Lane's confidence and his will to live through "language lessons" in the international language of love. The climactic scene involves a ski competition against Roy Stalin on a treacherous slope called the K-12. As the two rivals race, Johnny, Lane's persistent paperboy pursues him, repeating that he wants two dollars that are owed .
