{{Expand section}} Helen Harris  is very successful in the fashion industry and has a nice Manhattan lifestyle which keeps her extremely occupied and content. Helen's world suddenly changes when her sister Lindsay  and brother-in-law Paul  die in a car accident. Helen and her other sister Jenny  are in shock when they hear Lindsay & Paul left Helen in charge of their three kids: 15-year-old Audrey , 10-year-old Henry , and five-year-old Sarah . Convinced she can raise the kids and maintain her already fast-paced schedule, Helen quickly finds herself burnt out and disheartened by her responsibilities and Jenny's lack of faith. Despite her already hectic schedule, Helen finds the time to develop a genuine affection for her new dependents, as well as an equally genuine attraction to Dan Parker , the kids' school principal and local Lutheran pastor. Eventually, Helen realizes she can't balance the two lives, and is faced with a difficult decision, her fashion career or her nieces and nephew.
