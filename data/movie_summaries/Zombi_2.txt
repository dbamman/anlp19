An apparently abandoned yacht drifts into New York Harbor. When the Harbor Patrol investigates, a huge decomposing man kills one of the officers by biting his neck. The remaining officer shoots the hulking man, a zombie, who topples into the sea. The body of the deceased officer is deposited in the morgue. Ann Bolt  is questioned by the police, since the boat belonged to her father . She only knows that her father left for a tropical island to do research. Reporter Peter West  is assigned by his news editor  to report on the mysterious boat. Anne and Peter meet on the boat and discover a note from Anne's father saying he is on the island of Matool  suffering from a strange disease. Anne and Peter decide to investigate together. They arrive in the tropics and enlist the aid of a seafaring couple, Bryan Curt  and Susan Barrett , to help find the island. Matool is a cursed place where the dead rise to attack the living. Dr. David Menard , a resident on the island and physician at the local mission, is investigating its secrets. His contemptuous, highly strung wife Paola  wants to leave the island in fear of the increasing zombie attacks, but Menard insists on staying to continue his research. Anne, Peter, Brian, and Susan reach Matool. As they investigate, the zombies attack en masse, killing most of the mission's occupants, including Dr. Menard. Susan is later killed and returns as a zombie, infecting Brian. Peter and Anne escape by boat, taking the reanimated Brian with them as evidence. On reaching the open ocean, however, they receive a radio report that a plague of zombies has attacked New York City.
