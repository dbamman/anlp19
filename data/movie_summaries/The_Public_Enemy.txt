After Tom Powers  and his childhood friend, Matt Doyle , grow into young adults, the film follows them as they gradually progress from small crimes  to worse crimes , after being hired by local bootlegger Paddy Ryan . Tom quickly rises from apprentice to leading gangster by being more vicious and ruthless than his rivals. The bootlegging business becomes an ever more lucrative operation, and Tom and Matt are not shy about flaunting the trappings of gangsterism. Tom does not forget about his more humble origins, and offers support to his pathetically doting, and now widowed, mother. This brings him into conflict with his older brother, Mike Powers , a shell-shocked war veteran who strongly disapproves of his loathsome little brother. Arguably, underlying the fraternal conflict is the fact that Tom’s vicious immorality has brought generous material rewards while the straight-and-narrow path chosen by his brother has only produced a bitter casualty of war. Tom considers Mike self-righteous and hypocritical. When Mike quips that Tom's success is based on nothing more than “beer and blood” , Tom retorts: “Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.”{{cite web}} Tom continues his rise in gangland, but eventually his greed catches up with him when he challenges another gang, precipitating a catastrophic gang war. Arguably, the most famous scene is Tom “getting it” in the end, graphically setting the tone for the “crime doesn’t pay” theme that dominated crime films for the rest of the decade and beyond.
