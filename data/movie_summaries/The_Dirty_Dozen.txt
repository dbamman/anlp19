In England, in the spring of 1944, Allied forces are preparing for the D-Day invasion. Among them are Major John Reisman , an OSS officer; his commander, Regular Army Major General Worden , and his former commander Colonel Everett Dasher Breed . Early in the film the personalities of the three men are shown to clash and the characters of the individualistic Reisman and the domineering Breed are established. Reisman is aided by his friend, the mild mannered Major Max Armbruster  Major Reisman is assigned an unusual and top-secret pre-invasion mission: take a small unit of soldiers convicted of felonies and turn them into a commando squad to be sent on a special mission. The mission is an airborne infiltration and assault on a chateau near Rennes in Brittany. The chateau will be hosting a meeting of dozens of high ranking German officers, the elimination of which will presumably hamper the German military's ability to respond to D-Day. Those felons who survive the mission will have their sentences commuted. It quickly becomes clear that both Reisman and his superiors regard the operation as a near suicide mission and expect that few, if any of the felons will return. Reisman is assigned twelve convicts, all either serving lengthy sentences or destined to be executed. Notable members include slow witted Vernon Pinkley ; Robert Jefferson , an African American soldier convicted of killing a man in a racial brawl; Samson Posey  a gentle giant who becomes enraged when pushed; Joseph Wladislaw  a taciturn coal miner convicted of shooting his squad's medic who was recruited for his ability to speak German; A.J. Maggott , a misogynist and religious fanatic; and Victor Franko , a former member of the Chicago organized-crime Syndicate who has extreme problems with authority. Under the supervision of Reisman and military police Sergeant Bowren , the group begin training. After being forced to construct their own living quarters, the twelve individuals are trained in combat by Reisman and gradually learn how to operate as a group. For parachute training they are sent to the base operated by Colonel Breed. Under strict orders to keep their mission secret, Reisman's men run afoul of Breed and his troops, especially when Pinkley poses as a general and inspects Breed's troops. Angered at the usurpation of his authority, Breed attempts to discover Reisman's mission and then attempts to get the program shut down. Major Armbruster suggests a test of whether Reisman's men are ready: during practice maneuvers which Breed will be taking part in, the "Dirty Dozen" will attempt to capture the Colonel's headquarters. During the maneuvers, the men use various unorthodox tactics, including theft, impersonation, and rule breaking, to infiltrate Breed's headquarters and hold him and his men at gunpoint. This proves to the General that Reisman's men are ready. The night of the raid, the men are flown to France, and practise a rhyme they have learned which details their roles in the operation. There is a slight snag when one of the Dozen, Jiminez  breaks his neck and dies upon landing in a tree, but the others proceed with the mission. Wladislaw and Reisman infiltrate the meeting disguised as German officers while Franko and Maggott sneak onto the top floor of the building. The others set up in various locations around the chateau. The plan falls apart when Maggott sees one of the women who had accompanied the officers, abducts her at knifepoint, and orders her to scream. However the officers downstairs ignore her, thinking she is having sex. Maggott then stabs her and begins shooting, alerting the officers. As the officers and their companions retreat to an underground bomb shelter, a general firefight ensues between the Dozen and the German troops. After Wladislaw and Reisman lock the Germans in the bomb shelter, the Dozen pry open the ventilation ducts to the shelter and drop unprimed grenades down, then pour gasoline inside. Jefferson throws a primed grenade down each shaft and sprints for their vehicle, but is shot down as the grenades explode. Reisman, Bowren, Wladislaw, and Franko, the last remaining survivors of the assault team, are making their escape on a German half-track when Franko, shouting triumphantly that he has survived, is shot by a stray round. Back in England only Reisman, Bowren and Wladislaw have managed to get out alive. The film unfolds in three major acts. ===Act one - Identification and "recruiting" the prisoners=== After witnessing a hanging in a military jail in London, Major Reisman is briefed on the mission at General Worden's headquarters. As the credits to the film are rolling he walks along the line of 12 prisoners and stares at each of them as Sergeant Bowren  reads out their sentences. {| class="wikitable" |- ! scope="col" width="150" | Name ! scope="col" width="150" | Portrayed by ! scope="col" width="150" | Sentence |- | Franko, V.

Some details of their crimes are revealed and he uses a different approach with each of them in an effort to gain their cooperation. ===Act two - Training=== Depicts the unit building their own compound and training for the mission. It highlights the interpersonal conflict between the men, some of whom see the mission as a chance for redemption and others as a chance for escape. The second act places the mission, and the characters, in jeopardy when a breach of military regulations on Reisman's part forces General Worden, at Breed's urging, to have the men—now dubbed the "Dirty Dozen" by Sergeant Bowren because of their refusal to shave or bathe as a protest against their living conditions—prove their worth as soldiers at 'divisional maneuvers', a wargame in "Devonshire". ===Act three - The mission=== The final act, which was a mere footnote in the novel, is an action sequence detailing the attack on the chateau. The men recite the details of the attack in a chant in order to remember their roles: # Down to the road block, we've just begun # The guards are through # The Major's men are on a spree # Major and Wladislaw go through the door # Pinkley stays out in the drive # The Major gives the rope a fix # Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven # Jimenez has got a date # The other guys go up the line # Sawyer and Lever are in the pen # Posey guards points five and seven # Wladislaw and the Major go down to delve # Franko goes up without being seen # Zero-hour - Jimenez cuts the cable, Franko cuts the phone # Franko goes in where the others have been # We all come out like it's Halloween
