The film features Joan Baez, Donovan and Alan Price , Dylan's manager Albert Grossman and his road manager Bob Neuwirth; Marianne Faithfull, John Mayall, Ginger Baker, and Allen Ginsberg may also be glimpsed in the background. The film shows a young Dylan: confident if not arrogant, confrontational and contrary, but also charismatic and charming. Notable scenes include: *Dylan's extended taunting of Time Magazines London arts and science correspondent Horace Freeland Judson who was subjected to what he believes to be a contrived tirade of abuse from Dylan. *Dylan's interrupting Alan Price's backstage performance of "Little Things" to ask Price why he left The Animals. *Dylan and Baez singing Hank Williams songs in a hotel room, as well as Baez singing the first few verses of "Percy's Song" and "Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word"  *Dylan's pre-concert philosophical jousting with a "science student" . *Grossman negotiating with former Bebop Dance band leader and music agent, Tito Burns. *Dylan singing "Only a Pawn in Their Game" on July 6, 1963 at a Voters' Registration Rally in Greenwood, Mississippi .Dylan: Don't look back *A selection of songs from Dylan's Royal Albert Hall performance. *Dylan regaling the room with "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" after proclaiming "Hey, that's pretty GOOD, man!" in the middle of Donovan's performance of "To Sing for You". Dylan's romance with Baez had pretty much run its course by the time of the tour, and the film candidly captures what amounts to their breakup. The opening scene of the film also served as a kind of music video for Dylan's song "Subterranean Homesick Blues", in which the singer displays and discards a series of cue cards bearing selected words and phrases from the lyrics . Allen Ginsberg makes a cameo appearance during this episode.
