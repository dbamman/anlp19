A sexually frustrated woman  asks her friend Helen  for advice on how to achieve an orgasm. After a sex party provides no help, Helen recommends that Linda visit a doctor . The doctor discovers that Linda's clitoris is located in her throat, and after helping her develop her oral sex skills the infatuated Linda asks him to marry her. He informs her that she can settle for a job as his therapist, performing her particular oral technique—thereafter known as "deep throat"—on various men, until she finds the one to marry. Meanwhile, the doctor documents her exploits while repeatedly having sex with his nurse . The movie ends with the line "The End. And Deep Throat to you all." The 61-minute-long movie is intended to be humorous, with highly tongue-in-cheek dialogue and songs; fireworks going off and bells ringing during Lovelace's orgasms.
