Eventually they become very rich and Lady  grows very attracted to Paul . However Paul feels obligated to take care of a young woman named Lili  whose brother's death he caused . Lilli pretends to love Paul because he is rich, which Carrie is able to see, but which Paul does not. She devises a plan to make Lilli leave, if she will bribe some people to help get Lilli's true love out of jail, she will leave Paul. They go to break the man out of jail, but they are caught. Lilli is shot dead and Carrie gets sent to jail. An old lawyer friend  vows to fight for her freedom, but Carrie decides to plead guilty, because she doesn't want Lady to know about her past  and also because she fears that this damage to her reputation would also be bad for the reputation of the children.
