The Rugrats set sail on a ramshackle boat that Tommy's father, Stu, has rented in the South China Seas. The boat is flipped over by a rogue wave during a tropical storm and they are forced to abandon ship onto a life raft. They end up arriving on a small uninhabited island. On the same island, but on the other side, are the famous globe-trotting family the Thornberrys . The babies set off to find them for they suspect they are somewhere on the island . Somewhere along the way Chuckie gets lost and runs into the Thornberry's Tarzan-like child Donnie and the two switch clothes. Meanwhile Eliza, the gifted Thornberry, is exploring about the jungle and runs into Spike, the Pickles' dog. Since Eliza can talk to animals, Spike  talks for the first time and he informs her that the babies are lost somewhere on the island. While this is occurring Eliza's father, Nigel, finds the lost babies. He attempts to head in their direction but ends up tumbling down a hill and receives amnesia after a coconut falls on his head. Angelica  runs into Debbie, the teenage Thornberry, and takes off with Debbie in the Thornberry's all-purpose mobile communication vehicle . While not paying attention the twosome sink the commvee. Meanwhile, pop culture references to just about anything about castaways on an island  ensue. Also, unlike the previous movies, Susie tags along with Polaroid-like camera in hand and doesn't have her parents traveling with her. The film concludes with the children being reunited with their families. Photos of the families on the Lipschitz Cruise are shown during the end credits.
