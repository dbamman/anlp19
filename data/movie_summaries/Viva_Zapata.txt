Zapata  is part of a delegation sent to complain about injustices to corrupt longtime President Porfirio Díaz , but Díaz condescendingly dismisses their concerns. As a result, Zapata is driven to open rebellion, along with his brother Eufemio . He in the south and Pancho Villa  in the north unite under the leadership of naive reformer Francisco Madero . Díaz is finally toppled and Madero takes his place, but Zapata is dismayed to find that nothing is changed. The new regime is no less corrupt and self-serving than the one it replaced. His own brother sets himself up as a petty dictator, taking what he wants without regard for the law. The ineffectual but well-meaning Madero puts his trust in treacherous General Victoriano Huerta . Huerta first takes Madero captive and then has him murdered. Zapata himself is lured into an ambush and killed. Zapata is depicted in the film as an incorruptible rebel leader. He is guided by his desire to return the land to the peasants, who have been robbed, while forsaking his personal interest. Steinbeck meditates in the film on power, military and political, which corrupts men.
